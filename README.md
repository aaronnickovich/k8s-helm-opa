# What is this project?

This project is a basic application setup in Kubernetes. This project will remain provider agnostic as much as possible. Although my setup is going to be Docker Desktop for local, and EKS from Amazon for deployments. I also have docker-compose for a simple setup without K8s.

## Setup
Please have the following tools installed:
- helm
- docker
- OPA

for optional K8s deployment, please install the following tools:
- Terraform
- Kubernetes somewhere
- kubectl
- optionally, cloud provider CLI (az, aws, gcp, etc)
